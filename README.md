In this notebook I have coded alongside a section for building a cypher from Udemy's course presented by the Lazy Programmer entitled 'Data Science: Natural Language Programming in Python.' The section explores the use of an evolutionary algorithm to predict an encoded message. I start by creating a substitution cypher before building a language model based on the Markov matrix. I then download data to train the model, before setting up an encoding and decoding function. Lastly I build the evolutionary algorithm and then run it to see the results and how well it predicts the true text.
